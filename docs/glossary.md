# Glossary

## BFT

BFT stands for Byzantine Fault Tolerance. A BFT consensus algorithm is designed to tolerate both crashes and malicious actors in the network. This is in contrast to the [CFT](/glossary#cft) consensus algorithm designed to tolerate only crashes.

## Blockchain protocol

The blockchain protocol such as Hyperledger Fabric, Corda, MultiChain, Quorum, and Ethereum among several others.

## CFT

CFT stands for Crash Fault Tolerance. A CFT consensus algorithm is designed to tolerate only crashes. This is in contrast to the [BFT](/glossary#bft) consensus algorithm designed to tolerate not only crashes but also malicious actors in the network.

## Cloud

Deployment of the node on a public cloud such as Alibaba Cloud, Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform, and DigitalOcean.

## Consortium

Group of members that are part of a project; each member represents an organization.

## Hybrid

Depending on the blockchain protocol, a hybrid deployment could mean that some nodes of an organization are on-premises while others are on the public cloud.

## Member

An organization that is a participant in a project. An organization first creates a project and may then invite other organizations to participate in that project. For example, *Wheels Inc*, an auto manufacturer, could create a project called *Parts Tracking* and invite *Dreams Delivery*, its logistics partner. Once *Dreams Delivery* accepts the invite, it can view the *Parts Tracking* project and its constituent networks.

## Network

The actual blockchain network that comprises nodes.

## Node

Any computer that maintains a copy of the shared ledger.

## On-premises

Deployment of a node on the company’s own infrastructure.

## Project

In Chainstack, a project contains one or more blockchain networks related to a clearly defined business case. Creating a project is a prerequisite to creating a blockchain network. For example, an organization may have development and production blockchain networks related to a single business case such as parts tracking. In such a case, we recommend organizing both blockchain networks under one project called, for example, *Parts Tracking*.
