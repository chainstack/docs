# Service nodes

A Hyperledger Fabric network is deployed with the following service nodes:

* Explorer — a node running [Hyperledger Explorer](https://www.hyperledger.org/use/explorer) to scan and view the network. Each organization participating in a Hyperledger Fabric network has its own explorer node deployed.
* Orderer — an [ordering service node](/blockchains/fabric#ordering-service).
