# Types

Chainstack supports deploying a BNB Smart Chain node of the following types:

* Elastic — a highly scalable public network node infrastructure accessed through your exclusive endpoint.
* Dedicated — a dedicated node that is exclusive to you.

With an elastic node, you pay for JSON-RPC requests to the node and do not pay for the compute and storage resources used by the node.

With a dedicated node, you pay for the compute and storage resources used by the node and do not pay for JSON-RPC requests to the node.
