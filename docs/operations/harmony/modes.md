# Modes

Currently, Chainstack supports deploying Harmony full nodes.

With a Harmony full node, you can query the historical state of the Harmony mainnet at only the latest 128 blocks.

For Harmony archive nodes, there is a [feature request](https://ideas.chainstack.com/feature-requests/p/harmony-archive-nodes) that you can subscribe to and vote on.
