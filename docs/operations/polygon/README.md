# Introduction

This section outlines the fundamentals of and operations for Polygon PoS.

Deploying a Polygon PoS node with Chainstack provides you with a near-instantly fully synchronized Polygon PoS node through the use of [Bolt](/glossary/bolt).

Learn about [the supported networks](/operations/polygon/networks), [full and archive node modes](/operations/polygon/modes), and how to [interact with your node](/operations/polygon/tools).
