# Types

Chainstack supports deploying a Polygon PoS node of the following types:

* Shared — the node resources are shared with other platform users.
* Dedicated — the node resources are exclusive to you.

While a shared node's resources are not exclusive to you, the shared node's access and credentials are exclusive to each user.

You can also invite other [users](/glossary/user) to your [organization](/glossary/organization) to share the access and credentials of a dedicated or a shared node. See [Invite a user to the organization](/platform/invite-a-user-to-the-organization).
