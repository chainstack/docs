# Types

Chainstack supports deploying an Avalanche node of the following types:

* Elastic — a highly scalable public network node infrastructure accessed through your exclusive endpoint.
* Dedicated — a dedicated node that is exclusive to you.

You can also invite other [users](/glossary/user) to your [organization](/glossary/organization) to share the access and credentials of a dedicated or an elastic node. See [Invite a user to the organization](/platform/invite-a-user-to-the-organization).
