# Introduction

This section outlines the fundamentals of and operations for Avalanche.

Deploying an Avalanche node with Chainstack provides you with a near-instantly fully synchronized Avalanche node through the use of [Bolt](/glossary/bolt).

Learn about [the supported networks](/operations/avalanche/networks), [full and archive node modes](/operations/avalanche/modes), and how to [interact with your node](/operations/avalanche/tools).
