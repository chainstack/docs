# Modes

Currently, Chainstack supports deploying Solana full nodes. Full nodes store full blockchain data excluding an archive of historical states.

The full node can store in cache a set of historical states of up to the first block available on the node. This means you can query the historical state of the Solana mainnet at about 1.5 days worth if a node hasn't been purged.
