# Types

Chainstack supports deploying a Bitcoin node of the following types:

* Shared — the node resources are shared with other platform users.
* Dedicated — the node resources are exclusive to you.

While a shared node's resources are not exclusive to you, the shared node's access and credentials are exclusive to each user.

You can also invite other users to your organization to share the access and credentials of a dedicated or a shared node. See [Invite a user to the organization](platform/invite-a-user-to-the-organization).
