# Default addresses

You can view the default wallet addresses of each of your MultiChain node. See [View node access and credentials](/platform/view-node-access-and-credentials).

Adding a node to the network in MultiChain does not create an event that is broadcast to the blockchain. This means that address balances can only be queried by node owners.
