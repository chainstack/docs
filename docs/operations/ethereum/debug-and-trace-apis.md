# Debug and trace APIs

## Elastic nodes

You can deploy an [elastic](/glossary/elastic-node) Ethereum archive node with the enabled debug and trace APIs starting from the <a href="https://chainstack.com/pricing/" target="_blank">Business plan</a> as the Erigon [client implementation](/operations/ethereum/clients).

An elastic Ethereum archive node deployed as Erigon with the enabled debug and trace APIs exposes the `debug_*` and `trace_*` methods.

For the full list of the available debug and trace API methods, see [Erigon: RPC implementation status](https://github.com/ledgerwatch/erigon/blob/stable/cmd/rpcdaemon/README.md#rpc-implementation-status).

## Dedicated nodes

You can deploy [dedicated](/glossary/dedicated-node) Ethereum nodes starting from the <a href="https://chainstack.com/pricing/" target="_blank">Growth plan</a> as the Geth or Erigon [client implementation](/operations/ethereum/clients).

A dedicated Ethereum node deployed as Geth exposes the `debug_*` API methods.

A dedicated Ethereum node deployed as Erigon exposes the `debug_*` and `trace_*` API methods.

For the full list of the available debug and trace API methods, see:

* [Geth: debug namespace](https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/rpc/ns-debug)
* [Erigon: RPC implementation status](https://github.com/ledgerwatch/erigon/blob/stable/cmd/rpcdaemon/README.md#rpc-implementation-status)

Note that to debug and trace transactions, you need to have historical states on the node. Ethereum full nodes keep historical states for the immediately previous 128 blocks. Ethereum archive nodes keep historical states for the entire chain.

## Usage examples

You can debug and trace transactions by replaying them in the Ethereum Virtual Machine to get the execution details in the exact same way as they happened on the chain.

### debug_traceBlockByNumber

Trace all transactions included in a block with [debug_traceBlockByNumber](https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/rpc/ns-debug#debug_traceblockbynumber):

``` sh
curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"id": 1, "method": "debug_traceBlockByNumber", "params": ["BLOCK_NUMBER", {"tracer": "callTracer"}]}' ENDPOINT
```

where

* BLOCK_NUMBER — the number of the block to get the traces of included transactions. For Geth, you need to provide the block number in hex.
* ENDPOINT — your node HTTPS endpoint.

See [View node access and credentials](/platform/view-node-access-and-credentials).

For example, trace all smart contract interactions in [block 14976695](https://etherscan.io/txsInternal?block=14976695):

``` sh
curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"id": 1, "method": "debug_traceBlockByNumber", "params": ["0xE486B7", {"tracer": "callTracer"}]}' https://nd-123-456-789.p2pify.com/3c6e0b8a9c15224a8228b9a98ca1531d
```

### trace_block

Trace all transactions included in a block with [trace_block](https://openethereum.github.io/JSONRPC-trace-module#trace_block):

``` sh
curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"id": 1, "method": "trace_block", "params": ["BLOCK_NUMBER"]}' ENDPOINT
```

where

* BLOCK_NUMBER — the number of the block to get the traces of included transactions.
* ENDPOINT — your node HTTPS endpoint.

See [View node access and credentials](/platform/view-node-access-and-credentials).

For example, trace all smart contract interactions in [block 14976695](https://etherscan.io/txsInternal?block=14976695):

``` sh
curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"id": 1, "method": "trace_block", "params": ["14976695"]}' https://nd-123-456-789.p2pify.com/3c6e0b8a9c15224a8228b9a98ca1531d
