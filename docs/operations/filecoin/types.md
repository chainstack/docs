# Types

Chainstack supports deploying a Filecoin node of the following types:

* Elastic — a highly scalable public network node infrastructure accessed through your exclusive endpoint.
* Dedicated — a dedicated node that is exclusive to you.

With an elastic node, you pay for requests to the node and do not pay for the compute and storage resources used by the node.

With a dedicated node, you pay for the compute and storage resources used by the node and do not pay for requests to the node.
