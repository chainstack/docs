# Key management

By default, you can view your Quorum wallet addresses and keys specific to the node that you deployed, provided that you are logged in with Chainstack. See [View node access and credentials](/platform/view-node-access-and-credentials).

You can use the default wallet addresses and key pairs for development and testing purposes.

If you are moving your Quorum network to production, you are strongly recommended to use secure key management. [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) is one of the more popular choices with the Quorum community.
