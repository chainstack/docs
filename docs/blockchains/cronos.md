# Cronos

Cronos is an open-source and permissionless, layer-1 Ethereum-compatible blockchain network.

## Consensus

Cronos Chain is based on Ethermint and is built on the [Tendermint](https://tendermint.com/) Proof of Stake (PoS) Core Consensus Engine, and the [Cosmos SDK](https://v1.cosmos.network/sdk).

The Cronos consensus operates on a modified version of the Tendermint PoS consensus whereby validators are vetted by other validators, and are awarded staking tokens based on performance factors. The Cronos consensus is referred to as Proof of Authority (PoA) because new nodes require existing validators to authorize the provision of staking tokens to the new node validators.
