# Oasis Sapphire

The Oasis Sapphire is a layer 1 EVM-compatible blockchain protocol that uses its own parallel runtime technology called ParaTimes and is secured by the proof-of-stake consensus.

The Oasis Sapphire ParaTime allows for confidential smart contracts execution with another Oasis unique technology—Secure Enclave. Secure Enclave serves as a black box for smart contracts: a smart contract and encrypted data get decrypted and processed inside it, and then re-encrypted before being sent out of the box. By following this process, the confidentiality of the data is maintained and it is kept from being disclosed to the node operator or the DApp developer.
