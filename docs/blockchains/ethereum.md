# Ethereum

Ethereum is a public permissionless blockchain protocol.

Chainstack currently supports joining the following Ethereum networks:

* Mainnet — public Ethereum mainnet.
* Ropsten testnet — a proof-of-work public Ethereum testnet.
* Rinkeby testnet — a proof-of-authority public Ethereum testnet.
* Goerli testnet — a cross-client proof-of-authority public Ethereum testnet.

For development purposes on Ethereum testnets, fund your accounts with <a href="https://support.chainstack.com/hc/en-us/articles/900001458966-Ethereum-testnet-faucets" target="_blank">testnet ether</a>.
