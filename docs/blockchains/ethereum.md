# Ethereum

Ethereum is a public permissionless blockchain protocol.

Chainstack currently supports joining the following Ethereum networks:

* Mainnet — public Ethereum mainnet.
* Ropsten testnet — public Ethereum testnet.

For development purposes on the Ropsten testnet, fund your accounts with Ropsten ether at the [Ropsten faucet](https://faucet.ropsten.be/).
