# Ethereum

Ethereum is a public permissionless blockchain protocol.

Chainstack currently supports joining the following Ethereum networks:

* Ropsten testnet — public Ethereum testnet.

For development purposes on the Ropsten testnet, fund your accounts with <a href="https://support.chainstack.com/hc/en-us/articles/900001458966-Ethereum-Ropsten-faucets" target="_blank">Ropsten ether</a>.
