# Filecoin

Filecoin is an open-source decentralized storage network that includes native smart contract programmability through the Filecoin Virtual Machine (FVM).

## Consensus

Filecoin has the consensus algorithm called Expected Consensus. Under Expected Consensus, the transactions are ordered by the leaders elected for block validation rounds in accordance with the weight of their storage commits.

See Filecoin documentation: [Expected Consensus](https://spec.filecoin.io/algorithms/expected_consensus/).
