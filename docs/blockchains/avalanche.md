# Avalanche

Avalanche is an open-source platform for launching DApps and enterprise blockchain deployments.

Avalanche consists of the following main chains:

* Platform Chain (P-Chain) — the metadata chain that coordinates validators, tracks the X-Chains and the C-Chains, and allows for the creation of X-Chains and C-Chains.
* Exchange Chain (X-Chain) — the chain for creating and exchanging digital assets. The X-Chain is an instance of Avalanche Virtual Machine (AVM).
* Contract Chain (C-Chain) — the chain for smart contracts. The C-Chain is an instance of Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).

## Consensus

Avalanche has the [Snowman consensus](https://support.avax.network/en/articles/4058299-what-is-the-snowman-consensus-protocol) algorithm with validators that stake AVAX to participate in the consensus.
