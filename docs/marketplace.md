# Chainstack Marketplace 

## Introduction
The <a href="https://chainstack.com/marketplace/" target="_blank">Chainstack Marketplace</a> is designed to meet the needs of developers and connect tools to the Web3 infrastructure to build high quality apps and services. In addition to marketing and promotion, Chainstack Marketplace handles billing and integration with the infrastructure layer. This enables app developers to focus on bringing valuable enhancements and new features to Web3 services.  

Chainstack Marketplace includes the following types of products: 

* **Applications** — third-party apps to install on your nodes that add advanced capabilities to your networks.
* **Services** — complementary services that extend your nodes and networks. 
* **Developer tools** — tools designed to complement the blockchain development process. 

While we encourage app developers to submit a request to have their products listed on the Chainstack Marketplace, we cannot accept apps that do not meet our minimum requirements. 

This guide is designed to familiarize you with these requirements and provide instructions on submitting a request. 

## Listing requirements
We recommend that you read and consider the following minimum requirements before submitting a request.  

### Security requirements
All Chainstack Marketplace apps should do the following: 
* Encrypt sensitive customer data. 
* Not require the user to provide their Chainstack password. 
* Delete all Chainstack user data within 30 days of receiving a request from the user, or within 30 days of the end of the user's legal relationship with Chainstack. 
* Store client ID and client secret keys securely. 
* Encrypt data transferred over the public internet using HTTPS, with a valid TLS certificate. 

### Integration requirements
Ensure that your app meets the following necessary technical integration requirements: 
* **OAuth2 integration** — your app must use the OAuth2 authorization method. OAuth2 is a protocol that lets external applications request authorization to private details in a user's account without accessing their password.
* **Webhooks** — for privacy-compliance purposes, your app must be set up to use webhooks. OAuth2 authorization is required to access webhooks. 
* **Scopes** — apps must only request scopes that are required for your app. Before you apply, we recommend that you check to ensure that your scopes are not requesting unnecessary access. 
* **Notifications to customers** — support for handling and notifications to customers about plan upgrades or downgrades.  
  
### Support requirements
We require the following information to ensure that customers are provided with ongoing quality support:

* A **one-pager** for the Chainstack support team, summarizing the key features of your app. 
* An **SLA** for our support team (Community, Business processes from the app side, etc.). 
* The app **support team contact details** and the **estimated response time**. 
* **FAQs** of the app. 
* An up-to-date list of any **known issues** of the app. 

## Submit your request
Once you have read and are sure that you can meet the minimum requirements, you can submit the <a href="https://forms.office.com/r/CmFBBb1ySy" target="_blank">Chainstack Marketplace request form</a>. You must complete and accurately fill out the following fields of the form:

* **Developer name and website URL** — the name of the product developer and a link to the website. 
* **Description** — enter an informative, well written, description of your app. 
* **Screenshots** — some screenshots of your application that we can include on the Chainstack Marketplace.  
* **User documentation** — a URL to your up-to-date user documentation. 
* **Category** — choose from Application, Service, or Developer tool.  
* **Relevant protocols** — select all protocols from the list that are relevant to your app.
