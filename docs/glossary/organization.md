# Organization

An organization is the hierarchical ancestor of all your projects and nodes at Chainstack.

When you first <a href="https://console.chainstack.com/user/account/create" target="_blank">sign up with Chainstack</a>, an organization is automatically created for you and you become the admin user of this organization.

All subsequent [users](/glossary/user) invited to the organization have non-admin roles.
