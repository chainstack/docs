# Hybrid

A hybrid deployment means that some nodes of the same network are [on-premises](/glossary/on-premises) while others are on the public [cloud](/glossary/cloud).

::: warning
Currently Chainstack supports only [MultiChain hybrid network deployment](/operations/multichain/deploying-a-hybrid-network).
