# View node resources allocation

You can view the resources dynamically allocated to each of your [dedicated nodes](/glossary/dedicated-node).

To view the resources allocated to your nodes:

1. Click your project.
1. Click your network.
1. Click the node name.
1. Under **Resources**, hover over **Dynamic**.

## Understand node resources allocation

Ethereum:

* Node — the CPU, memory, storage, and ancient storage allocated to your Ethereum node. The ancient storage is for the Geth freezer database to separately keep the ledger data older than three epochs. See also [an Ethereum blog post](https://blog.ethereum.org/2019/07/10/geth-v1-9-0/) for the detailed freezer explanation.

Note that you are not charged for the ancient storage.

Polygon PoS:

* Node — the CPU, memory, storage, and ancient storage allocated to your Polygon PoS node.

Note that you are not charged for the ancient storage.

BNB Smart Chain:

* Node — the CPU, memory, storage, and ancient storage allocated to your BNB Smart Chain node.

Note that you are not charged for the ancient storage.

Avalanche:

* Node — the CPU, memory, and storage allocated to your Avalanche node.

Arbitrum:

* Node — the CPU, memory, and storage allocated to your Arbitrum node.

NEAR:

* Node — the CPU, memory, and storage allocated to your NEAR node.

Aurora:

* Node — the CPU, memory, and storage allocated to your Aurora node.

Solana:

* Node — the CPU, memory, and storage allocated to your Solana node.

Gnosis Chain:

* Node — the CPU, memory, and storage allocated to your Gnosis Chain node.

Cronos:

* Node — the CPU, memory, and storage allocated to your Cronos node.

Fantom:

* Node — the CPU, memory, and storage allocated to your Fantom node.

StarkNet:

* Node — the CPU, memory, and storage allocated to your StarkNet node.

Harmony:

* Node — the CPU, memory, and storage allocated to your Harmony node.

Tezos:

* Node — the CPU, memory, and storage allocated to your Tezos node.

Fuse:

* Node — the CPU, memory, and storage allocated to your Fuse node.

Bitcoin:

* Node — the CPU, memory, and storage allocated to your Bitcoin node.

Hyperledger Fabric:

* Node — the storage allocated to your peer to maintain the state and a copy of the ledger.
* Peer — the CPU and memory allocated to your peer.
* Chaincode server — the CPU and memory allocated to the service running your chaincode.

Corda:

* Node — the CPU, memory, and storage allocated to your Corda node.
* Database — the CPU, memory, and storage allocated to your [Corda node database](https://docs.corda.net/docs/corda-os/node-database.html).

Quorum:

* Node — the storage allocated to your Quorum node to maintain the ledger.
* Geth — the CPU and memory allocated to GoQuorum.
* Transaction manager — the CPU and memory allocated to the Tessera transaction manager. See also Quorum documentation: [What is Tessera](https://docs.tessera.consensys.net/).

MultiChain:

* Node — the CPU, memory, and storage allocated to your MultiChain node.
