# Invite a member to the project

In a [consortium project](/glossary/consortium-project), you can always invite a member who will:

* Deploy nodes and networks as part of your project.
* Access the project's nodes and networks details.

To invite a member:

1. Click a project.
1. Click **Members** > **Invite member**.

This will send an email invitation to join the project.
