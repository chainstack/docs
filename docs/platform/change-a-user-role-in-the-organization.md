# Change a user role in the organization

You can [invite a user](/platform/invite-a-user-to-the-organization) as an Admin, Editor, or Viewer.

For full role details, see <a href="https://support.chainstack.com/hc/en-us/articles/900001563563" target="_blank">Organizations, users, and members</a>.

Once the invited user joins the organization, you can change the user's role.

To change the role:

1. Click **Settings** > **Organization**.
1. Next to the user, click the edit icon.
1. Select the new role **Admin**, **Editor**, or **Viewer**.
1. Click **Update**.

This will change the role of the user.

The user whose role is changed will need to relogin for the changes to take effect.
