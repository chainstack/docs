# Manage your organization identities

You can add and delete new identities in your organization [vault](https://console.chainstack.com/vault).

Chainstack currently supports identity management for the following networks:

* Hyperledger Fabric networks
* [Corda Network](https://corda.network/)
* [Corda Pre-Production Network](https://corda.network/participation/preprod)

## Manage your Hyperledger Fabric identity

A Hyperledger Fabric identity is a private key and a certificate. See Hyperledger Fabric documentation: [Identity](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-2.2/identity/identity.html).

A Hyperledger Fabric identity issuer is the entity issuing certificates. Chainstack supports [cryptogen](/glossary/cryptogen) or [Fabric CA](/glossary/fabric-ca) as an identity issuer.

Each organization on Chainstack must have an identity and an identity issuer to deploy a Hyperledger Fabric network or add a node to an existing network.

### Add a new identity

By default, your identity is issued automatically by [cryptogen](/glossary/cryptogen).

If you would like to use [Fabric CA](/glossary/fabric-ca) as identity issuer, <a href="https://chainstack.com/contact/" target="_blank">contact Chainstack</a>.

## Manage your Corda identity

A Corda identity consists of the following Java KeyStore (JKS) files:

* `nodekeystore.jks` — a keystore with the node's identity key pairs and certificates; protected by **Keystore password**.
* `sslkeystore.jks` — a keystore with the node's TLS key pair and certificate; protected by **Keystore password**.
* `truststore.jks` — a keystore with the network operator's root certificate; protected by **Truststore password**.

### Add a new identity

1. Complete steps 1 and 2 of the [Corda Onboarding Workflow guide](https://corda.network/joining-corda-network/onboarding-workflow).
1. On Chainstack, navigate to  <a href="https://console.chainstack.com/vault" target="_blank">your vault</a>. Click **Add identity**.
