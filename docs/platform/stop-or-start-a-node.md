# Stop or start a node

You can stop and start your deployed nodes.

A stopped node retains its states and does not incur metered compute costs. A stopped node does incur storage costs.

To stop or start a node:

1. Click your project.
1. Click a network in the project.
1. Select the node to stop or start. Click **Stop** or **Start**.

In a [consortium project](/glossary/consortium-project), stopping the first deployed node will stop the entire network, including the service nodes.
