# Top up your balance with crypto

Chainstack deducts your subscription and node usage costs from your account balance.

If your account balance is not sufficient, your credit card will be charged for the outstanding amount.

You can top up your balance with your Coinbase account or directly with cryptocurrency.

## Top up with a Coinbase account

1. Click **Top up with crypto**.
1. Select a predefined amount or type in your amount. Click **Next**.
1. Click **Pay with Coinbase**.

This will sign you to your Coinbase account and use your account's crypto balance to top up the Chainstack account balance.

## Top up with a non-custodial wallet
