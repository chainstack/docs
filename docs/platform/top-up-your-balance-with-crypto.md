# Top up your balance with crypto

Chainstack deducts your subscription and node usage costs from your account balance.

If your account balance is not sufficient, your credit card will be charged for the outstanding amount.

You can top up your balance with your Coinbase account, BTC, ETH, or USDC.

To top up the balance with your Coinbase account:

1. Go to [Billing](https://console.chainstack.com/user/settings/billing).
1. Click **Top up with crypto**.
1. Select a predefined amount or type in your amount. Click **Next**.
1. Click **Pay with Coinbase**.

This will sign you to your Coinbase account and use your account's BTC, ETH, or USDC balance to top up the Chainstack account balance.

::: warning

For ETH or USDC, you can only use the Ethereum mainnet.

No other coins or tokens are accepted. No other networks are supported.

You will lose your funds if you send anything other than ETH or USDC on the Ethereum mainnet or BTC on the Bitcoin mainnet.
