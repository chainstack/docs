# Delete a node

To be able to delete a project or a network, you must first delete all nodes associated with the network.

To delete a node:

1. Click your project.
1. Click a network in the project.
1. Select the node to delete. Click **Edit** > **Delete**.

This will delete the node.

When deleting nodes in a [consortium project](/glossary/consortium-project), you can only delete the first deployed node after deleting all other nodes in the network.
