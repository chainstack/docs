# View node access and credentials

To view the access information:

1. Click your project.
1. Click your network.
1. Click the node name.

This will give you the access and credentials to your nodes.

If you are an invited [member](/glossary/member) of a [consortium project](/glossary/consortium-project), you will be able to see the basic access information of other nodes in the project.
