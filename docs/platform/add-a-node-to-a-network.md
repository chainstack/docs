# Add a node to a network

Once you have [deployed a consortium network](/platform/deploy-a-consortium-network) or [joined a public network](/platform/join-a-public-network), you can add more nodes to the network.

For consortium networks, you can add a node to run in [cloud](/glossary/cloud) or [on-premises](/glossary/on-premises). On-premises nodes can only be deployed in [hybrid](/glossary/hybrid) networks. 

For public networks, you can add a [shared](/glossary/shared-node) or a [dedicated](/glossary/dedicated-node) node.

To add a node:

1. Select the project with the network.
1. Select the network.
1. Click **Add node**.

The status will change from **Pending** to **Running** once deployed.
