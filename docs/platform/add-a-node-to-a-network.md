# Add a node to a network

Once you have [deployed a consortium network](/platform/deploy-a-consortium-network) or [joined a public network](/platform/join-a-public-network), you can add more nodes to the network.

For consortium networks, you can add a node to run in [cross-cloud](/glossary/cross-cloud), [cross-region](/glossary/cross-region), and [hybrid](/glossary/hybrid) networks starting from the Enterprise <a href="https://chainstack.com/pricing/" target="_blank">subscription plan</a>.

For public networks, you can add an [elastic](/glossary/elastic-node) or a [dedicated](/glossary/dedicated-node) node.

To add a node:

1. Select the project with the network.
1. Select the network.
1. Click **Add node**.

The status will change from **Pending** to **Running** once deployed.
